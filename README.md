# AutoOrderTexting

Automated text message ordering for restaurants.

This project uses a flask back-end, Twilio's text-message API, and MongoDB. Restaurants can link Twilio numbers to this server and enter 
their information (including their menu) to our MongoDB database to allow customers to order off their specific menu items automatically through 
messages. This system is scalable and production-ready.
